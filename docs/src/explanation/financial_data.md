# Financial Data

## Two Levels of Financial Data

PSIP separates financial parameters into two levels:

| Level      | Type                              | Scope            | Controls                            |
|:---------- |:--------------------------------- |:---------------- |:----------------------------------- |
| Portfolio  | [`PortfolioFinancialData`](@ref)  | All technologies | Discount rate, inflation, base year |
| Technology | [`TechnologyFinancialData`](@ref) | One technology   | Capital recovery factor parameters  |

Portfolio-level parameters set the economic context for the entire optimization. Technology-level parameters determine how each technology's overnight capital cost is annualized into a per-year payment.

### `PortfolioFinancialData` Fields

| Field            | Type      | Description                                                                                  |
|:---------------- |:--------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base_year`      | `Int64`   | Reference year for discounting and inflation; all costs are expressed in this year's dollars |
| `discount_rate`  | `Float64` | Social or WACC discount rate (fraction per year, e.g., `0.07`)                               |
| `inflation_rate` | `Float64` | General inflation rate (fraction per year, e.g., `0.025`)                                    |
| `interest_rate`  | `Float64` | Nominal interest rate for financing (fraction per year)                                      |

### `TechnologyFinancialData` Fields

| Field                     | Type      | Description                                                                                      |
|:------------------------- |:--------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `capital_recovery_period` | `Int64`   | Years over which capital cost is recovered                                                       |
| `technology_base_year`    | `Int64`   | Year in which the overnight capital cost is quoted; used for inflation adjustment to `base_year` |
| `debt_fraction`           | `Float64` | Share of capital financed by debt (0–1)                                                          |
| `debt_rate`               | `Float64` | Nominal annual interest rate on the debt portion                                                 |
| `return_on_equity`        | `Float64` | Required annual return on the equity portion                                                     |
| `tax_rate`                | `Float64` | Combined marginal state and federal tax rate                                                     |

## Capital Recovery Factor

The capital recovery factor (CRF) converts an overnight capital cost (USD/MW at construction) into an annualized payment (USD/MW/year). PSI computes the CRF from `TechnologyFinancialData` using a standard formula that accounts for the after-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

The key quantities are:

  - After-tax debt cost: `debt_rate × (1 - tax_rate)`
  - After-tax equity cost: `return_on_equity × (1 - tax_rate)`
  - WACC: `debt_fraction × debt_rate × (1 - tax_rate) + (1 - debt_fraction) × return_on_equity`
  - CRF: `WACC × (1 + WACC)^N / ((1 + WACC)^N - 1)`, where `N = capital_recovery_period`

The CRF represents the fraction of the overnight cost that must be recovered each year to pay back debt and equity investors over the recovery period. Multiplying the overnight capital cost by the CRF gives the annual capital payment that enters the objective function.

!!! note
    
    The exact formula used by PSI may differ in detail. These parameters are passed through to PSI unchanged; refer to the PSI documentation for the precise CRF calculation.

## How PSI Uses These Values

PSI reads financial data from the Portfolio at model construction time:

  - `PortfolioFinancialData` feeds the `DiscountedCashFlow` object, which defines the investment horizon and discount framework for the entire optimization.
  - `TechnologyFinancialData` is used to compute the annualized capital cost for each technology candidate. If a technology does not have `TechnologyFinancialData` attached, PSI falls back to portfolio-level parameters.

The annualized cost is what the optimizer actually minimizes. Costs are expressed as net present value of all annualized capital and operating payments over the planning horizon, discounted back to `base_year` using the portfolio `discount_rate`.

## `technology_base_year` and Cost Inflation

Capital costs for different technologies may be quoted in different vintage years — for example, wind costs from a 2020 study and solar costs from a 2025 study. Mixing these directly would produce inconsistent cost comparisons.

PSI uses the difference between `technology_base_year` and the portfolio `base_year`, together with the portfolio `inflation_rate`, to escalate or deflate each technology's quoted overnight cost to a consistent present-value basis before computing the annualized cost.

For example: a wind technology with `technology_base_year = 2020`, a portfolio `base_year = 2030`, and `inflation_rate = 0.025` would have its overnight capital cost scaled by `(1.025)^10` before the CRF is applied. A technology whose `technology_base_year` is later than `base_year` would be deflated by the same mechanism.

This adjustment ensures that all technology candidates are evaluated on a consistent cost basis regardless of when their cost estimates were produced.
