# The Sienna Stack

`PowerSystemsInvestmentsPortfolios.jl` is one package in a layered stack of Sienna
packages. Understanding where PSIP sits in that stack helps clarify what each package is
responsible for and which one to reach for at each stage of a capacity expansion workflow.

## Package layers

| Layer | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Data infrastructure | [`InfrastructureSystems.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/InfrastructureSystems.jl) | Shared component framework, time series storage, serialization |
| Grid snapshots | [`PowerSystems.jl`](https://sienna-platform.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/) | Buses, generators, loads, lines — steady-state grid data |
| **Investment portfolios** | **`PowerSystemsInvestmentsPortfolios.jl`** | **Technologies, regions, requirements, financial data — this package** |
| Investment optimization | [`PowerSystemsInvestments.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSystemsInvestments.jl) | Builds and solves capacity expansion models from a `Portfolio` |

## Data flow

A typical capacity expansion workflow moves data through the stack in order:

1. **`InfrastructureSystems.jl`** provides the underlying component and time series
   infrastructure. Both PSY and PSIP build on top of it; most users never interact with it
   directly.
2. **`PowerSystems.jl`** holds the existing grid snapshot — buses, existing generators,
   loads, and transmission lines. A [`Portfolio`](@ref) always references a `PSY.System`
   as its `base_system`.
3. **`PowerSystemsInvestmentsPortfolios.jl`** (this package) adds the investment layer:
   technology candidates, planning regions, policy requirements, and time series profiles
   for the investment horizon.
4. **`PowerSystemsInvestments.jl`** reads the `Portfolio` and builds the optimization
   model. After solving, investment decisions are written back into the `Portfolio`'s
   `investment_schedule` field.
