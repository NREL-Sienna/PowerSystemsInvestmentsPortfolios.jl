"""
Bidirectional id<->component resolution context for one OpenAPI conversion pass.

Fields:

  - `by_topology_id::Dict{Int, Any}`: Id → base-system topology component (buses, areas,
    load zones, arcs). Seeded from the portfolio's base `PSY.System`.
  - `by_component_id::Dict{Int, Any}`: Id → portfolio component (requirements,
    technologies), populated by `setindex!` as each is converted.
  - `id_by_component::IdDict{Any, Int}`: Component → id, the reverse of both forward maps,
    keyed by object identity (globally unique, so a single map suffices).

Topology lives in the base `PSY.System` and portfolio components in `portfolio.data`; those
are two independent `InfrastructureSystems` id counters, so their integer ids overlap (both
start at 1). The forward direction is therefore split into two maps and every read names the
family it wants — through the referenced field's declared type — so an id shared by a
topology component and a portfolio component resolves unambiguously to the right one.

Populated in dependency order as components are converted (topology seeded up front, then
requirements before the technologies that reference them, etc.) An id or a component that
has not been registered yet is malformed input, not an absence to tolerate: the typed
[`resolve_ref`](@ref) and [`component_id`](@ref) error loudly naming what was missing rather
than returning `nothing`. Use [`has_ref`](@ref) / [`has_component_id`](@ref) first when
absence is itself a valid outcome to branch on.
